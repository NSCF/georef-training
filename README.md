# NSCF Georeferencing training tool

A Svelte app for practicing georeferencing with a group of trainees. The leader posts a locality string, the trainees try to georeference it. When everyone is done the leader reveals the georefs (anonymously) to all. 

Visit [georeftraining.nscf.org.za](https://georeftraining.nscf.org.za) to see it in action. If you don't see an option to make yourself the leader it means training is underway...
